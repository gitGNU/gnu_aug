MinGW Build:

1. Verify that cygwin's mingw toolchain and w32api packages are installed.
2. Run config.pl in the base directory, and ensure that:
   a) "cygwin build for mingw host" is selected as the compiler toolset.
   b) where unavailable, python, ruby and ssl support are disabled.
3. Run the resulting config.sh, to configure.

Cyclic Dependencies

Care must be taken not to introduce cyclic dependencies, especially between:

utility -> log -> base -> errinfo -> string

utility - aug_perrinfo() and aug_perror() are placed here to break cycles
between the remaining components.

log - loglevel is intialised in aug_init() and protected by aug_lock().

base - uses aug_seterrinfo().

errinfo - uses aug_strerror().

string - lowest level component.
