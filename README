MinGW Build:

1. Verify that cygwin's mingw toolchain and w32api packages are installed.
2. Run config.pl in the base directory, and ensure that:
   a) "cygwin build for mingw host" is selected as the compiler toolset.
   b) where unavailable, python, ruby and ssl support are disabled.
3. Run the resulting config.sh, to configure.

$ cp c:/WINNT/system32/ssleay32.dll c:/WINNT/system32/libssleay32.dll 
$ cd $OPENSSL_HOME/lib/MinGW/
$ cp ssleay32.a libssleay32.a
$ cp lib*.a /lib/mingw/

If "make check" is failing, try installing the package first to ensure that
the DLLs are visible on your PATH.

MSVC++ Build:

Add the following vc++ directories:

$(OPENSSL_HOME)\include
$(PYTHON_HOME)\include
$(RUBY_HOME)\lib\ruby\1.8\i386-mswin32

$(OPENSSL_HOME)\lib\VC
$(PYTHON_HOME)\libs
$(RUBY_HOME)\lib

Thread-safety Classifications:

thread-safe
thread-compatible
