MinGW Build:

1. Verify that cygwin's mingw toolchain and w32api packages are installed.
2. Run config.pl in the base directory, and ensure that:
   a) "cygwin build for mingw host" is selected as the compiler toolset.
   b) where unavailable, python, ruby and ssl support are disabled.
3. Run the resulting config.sh, to configure.

$ cp c:/WINNT/system32/ssleay32.dll c:/WINNT/system32/libssleay32.dll 
$ cd $OPENSSL_HOME/lib/MinGW/
$ cp ssleay32.a libssleay32.a
$ cp lib*.a /lib/mingw/

If "make check" is failing, try installing the package first to ensure that
the DLLs are visible on your PATH.

MSVC++ Build:

Add the following vc++ directories:

$(OPENSSL_HOME)\include
$(PYTHON_HOME)\include
$(RUBY_HOME)\lib\ruby\1.8\i386-mswin32

$(OPENSSL_HOME)\lib\VC
$(PYTHON_HOME)\libs
$(RUBY_HOME)\lib

FAQ

1. What does the COPYING file contain?

A verbatim copy of the following document:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt

2. Can the years on the license notice be summarised in a range, such as
   2004-2009?

Ideally, gnu.org want the years to be explicitly listed rather than in a
range.  There is some confusion on why they want this, but it related to
international laws.  They have a Berne copyright law, but not all countries
have signed it.  So those at gnu.org convinced it is better to play it safe
than be sorry.

3. If I build with OpenSSL support, doesn't this break the GPL license
   agreement?

No.  The following exception has been added to the license agreement.

"This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption that
compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed."

4. Aug is targeted at MacOS, Windows, and Posix compliant systems.  Does it
   depend on any non-free system?

No.  Aug does not depend on any non-free systems.

5. Are there any dependencies?  If so, provide the link to those dependencies
   with the license that they use.
