MinGW Build:

1. Verify that cygwin's mingw toolchain and w32api packages are installed.
2. Run config.pl in the base directory, and ensure that:
   a) "cygwin build for mingw host" is selected as the compiler toolset.
   b) where unavailable, python, ruby and ssl support are disabled.
3. Run the resulting config.sh, to configure.
