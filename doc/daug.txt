Basic Installation
==================

  1. Run the MSI installer.  Before changing the destination folder from the
     default, please read the FAQ, below.

  2. From the installation directory, copy the 'etc\daug.conf.default' file
     to 'etc\daug.conf'.

  3. Change the 'etc\daug.conf' file as appropriate.  At least, the 'rundir'
     option should be set to the absolute path of the installation directory.
     The file extension of any modules may also need to change.

  4. Run the 'install.bat' file in the installation directory: this will
     register the service with the Service Control Manager.

  5. To start the service, run the 'start.bat' file in the installation
     directory.

FAQ
===

  1. Why do I receive a 'The system cannot open the device or file specified.'
     error when trying to install the MSI?

     This error is often followed by:

     The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this
     package.  This may indicate a problem with this package.  The error code
     is 2755.

     If you are using an encrypted file system, decrypt the MSI installer and
     rerun.

  2. Why does the following message appear in the log file?

     'import site' failed; use -v for traceback
     ImportError: No module named traceback

     If you are using an encrypted file system, recursively decrypt the
     directory to which Python was installed.

  2. Why do I receive an 'Access Denied' error when attempting to start the
     service?

     By default the Service will be run using the system's 'Network Service'
     account.  As with the 'Local System' account, access may be restricted to
     certain areas of the file system.

     This may occur when installing to destination directories other than the
     default.

     This issue can be resolved by either a) re-installing to a shared
     (common) area of the file system, or b) running the service under an
     alternate account.
